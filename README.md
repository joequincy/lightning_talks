# DEMO NIGHT!

Voting app for competitions. 

I am writing Sal's Readme because he hasn't written it, but still wants help. Yup. I'm calling you out in your own readme.

```
fork, clone & cd into the project
bundle
gem install figaro
bundle exec figaro install
```

Open the project up in your favorite editor and add a `GITHUB_KEY` and `GITHUB_SECRET` for Github Oauth.

Sal probably won't merge this PR, but he'll update the readme soon based on this PR.
